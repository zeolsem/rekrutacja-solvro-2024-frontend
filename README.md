# My take on frontend task for Solvro 2024 autumn recruitment.

### Tech Stack used: TypeScript, React, Tailwind CSS, axios, tanstack-query, react-router.
#### Warn: there is a known bug where if you have over 15 favorited cocktails, the surplus ones are not showing.

#### *Pre-project thoughts:*
*The goal is to build a web app that allows to fetch and look through Solvro Cocktail API.*

*I have never used TypeScript before, the goal is to learn it during this project.*

## Post-project update: 
I have learned some TypeScript, along with Context API and using LocalStorage. 

The code should is badly documented, and there are some TypeScript errors (using `any` type for the query), that I did not have time to resolve.

Overall, it was a fun task. I do not know for how long the API will be accessible, so if you want to try it out, do it now.


Side note: Some ingredients are incorrectly attached to cocktails in API. I don't know if this is intentional, in any case I do not intend to implement any workaround for this in the app.
